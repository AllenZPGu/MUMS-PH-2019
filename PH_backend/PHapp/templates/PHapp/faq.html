	<h2>Q: Who are you, and what is MUMS?</h2>
	<p>We are the Melbourne University Mathematics and Statistics Society (MUMS), a student organisation for maths students and enthusiasts at the University of Melbourne in Australia. We hold many events throughout the year, such as this puzzlehunt, Maths Olympics, seminars, games nights and many other activities. Please visit our <a href='https://www.facebook.com/MelbUniMathsStats/'>Facebook page</a> and chuck us a like!</p>

	<p>MUMS has held annual puzzlehunts most year since 2004. We are extremely excited to revive it for 2019! Some writers of this Puzzlehunt are University of Melbourne students who regularly compete in online puzzlehunts under the team "Green Blazers".</p>

	<h2>Q: What is a "Puzzlehunt"?</h2>
	<p>A puzzlehunt is typically competition where teams solve a series of puzzles. These puzzles are not your standard newspaper puzzles like Sudoku, where you know the rules of the puzzle. Rather, you usually receive no information or guidance on how to solve the puzzles; half the fun is figuring out where to start!</p>

	<p>If you are new to online puzzlehunts, we recommend that you check out some previous hunts, such as:</p>
