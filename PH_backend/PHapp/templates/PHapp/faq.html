	<h2>Q: Who are you, and what is MUMS?</h2>
	<p>We are the Melbourne University Mathematics and Statistics Society (MUMS), a student organisation for maths students and enthusiasts at the University of Melbourne in Australia. We hold many events throughout the year, such as this puzzlehunt, Maths Olympics, seminars, games nights and many other activities. Please visit our <a href='https://www.facebook.com/MelbUniMathsStats/'>Facebook page</a> and chuck us a like!</p>

	<p>MUMS has held annual puzzlehunts most year since 2004. We are extremely excited to revive it for 2019! Some writers of this Puzzlehunt are University of Melbourne students who regularly compete in online puzzlehunts under the team "Green Blazers".</p>

	<h2>Q: What is a "Puzzlehunt"?</h2>
	<p>A puzzlehunt is typically competition where teams solve a series of puzzles. These puzzles are not your standard newspaper puzzles like Sudoku, where you know the rules of the puzzle. Rather, you usually receive no information or guidance on how to solve the puzzles; half the fun is figuring out where to start!</p>

	<p>If you are new to online puzzlehunts, we recommend that you check out some previous hunts, such as:</p>

	<p>Please familiarise yourself with the specific <a href='../rules/'>rules</a> of this puzzlehunt.</p>

	<h2>Q: Does my team need to pay to enter?</h2>
	<p>Entry is completely free!!</p>
	<p>However, we do have a PayPal donation box where you can support the hunt. Running a puzzlehunt takes a phenomenal amount of time and effort, and we have costs such as website hosting to consider. We at MUMS are all students who run this hunt in our spare time. Every little donation will help keep the hunt running for another year.</p>
	<p>We recommend a small donation of $2 AUD for every person on your team. This is half the price of a coffee, in exchange for 10 days worth of fun! That said, feel free to donate as much or as little as you wish. All donations will remain anonymous and will not affect your team's performance in the hunt in any way. Thank you so so so much for your support!!</p>
