	<p>This puzzle is presented as a list of tickets, each with a QR code, a time, a seat number, and some extra information, varying across the tickets. If we scan the QR codes, we are taken to twelve different YouTube videos, each for a song from a different musical. In order, the musicals are: <i>Legally Blonde, Hamilton, Les Misérables, The Phantom of the Opera, Beauty and the Beast, The Book of Mormon, Grease 2, Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again, Cats, Matilda the Musical, Wicked, Little Women.</i></p>
	
	<p>Looking at the tickets, we might then realise that each ticket clues for one of the twelve musicals:</p>

	<table class="table table-bordered">

	</table>

	<p>The only remaining pieces of information left on the tickets are the time and the seat number. If we match up the ticket to the QR code, and go to the point in the linked YouTube video indicated by the time on the matching ticket, we should find a single word from each song. If we order these words in the order of the QR codes, the resultant message is "SEAT LETTERS GIVE SONG TUNE AND SEAT NUMBER GIVES LINE THEN LETTER".</p>

	<p>We should then look at the seat numbers on the tickets. If we order the seat numbers in the same order as their matching QR codes, as is consistent with the previous step of the puzzle, then we get 68C 26D 48E 32C 19E 37C 71E 12D 58E 38F 29F 15E. The first half of the message suggests that the seat letters should give a song tune, as does the title 'Musical Chairs'. Reading the letters off this ordering gives CDECECEDEFFE which the solver could either recognise as the tune of "Doe a Deer" from <i>The Sound of Music</i>, or by searching something along the lines of 'musical songs in C major', as was done by one of our test solvers. The rest of the message indicates that the seat numbers should provide the line, then the letter. The solver should then use these seat numbers to index the line number and letter number from "Doe a Deer":</p>

	<center><i>
	Doe, a deer, a female deer</br>
	Ray, a drop of golden sun</br>
	Me, a name I call myself</br>
	Far, a long, long way to run</br>
	Sew, a needle pulling thread</br>
	La, a note to follow so</br>
	Tea, a drink with jam and bread</br>
	That will bring us back to do oh oh oh
	</i></center>

	<br>

	<p>For example, seat 68 indicates line 6 (La, a note to follow so), and letter 8, i.e. 'T'. Repeating this for all twelve seats yields the phrase TO LIFE TO LIFE. A quick Google will reveal that this is a phrase from the number "To Life" in the musical <i>Fiddler on the Roof</i>. This is not quite the answer yet, since "to life" appears twice in this phrase. Diving into the lyrics of the number itself, we find that the line containing TO LIFE TO LIFE is completed by the word <b>L'CHAIM</b> (the Hebrew word for "to life"), which is the answer phrase.</p>

	<br>

	<h4>Authors' note:</h4>
	<p>Apologies for the incorrectly copied QR code on the ninth ticket - it was a duplicate of ticket eight instead of the correct link. Thanks to those who pointed it out so it could quickly be rectified! One nice extra touch is that the puzzle Musical Chairs is about musicals, features 'musical chairs' – seats that sing out a song – and the children's game Musical Chairs is also known as Trip to Jerusalem, which links thematically with the final answer :)</p>
